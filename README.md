Here are some ideas to get you started:

- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on my certificate in Data Science and Business Analytics at UT Austin
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning SQL, Tableau, Python, course-building and every data science subject I can get my hands on.
- üëØ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on solutions for ‚¨ÜÔ∏è healthcare costs with ‚¨áÔ∏è outcomes, the "Nones", and anything to do with making everyday folks' lives better.
- ü§î I‚Äôm looking for help on how to run a sub-20:00 5k without getting injured.
- üí¨ Ask me about my experience homeschooling my four kids.
- üì´ How to reach me: Message me on LinkedIn or email me at lynch_r@me.com
- ‚ö° Fun fact: I ran my first marathon solo in May 2020 even after the race was cancelled (no way I was going to waste all that training).
